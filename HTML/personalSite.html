    <p>I am Maria Paula Tellez, a systems and computer engineer from the University of Los Andes in Colombia. With my strong educational background in computer engineering, I have taken my skills to the next level as a software developer intern at Accenture. My passion for technology  led me to also serve as a teaching assistant for a mobile app building class.
